# WTN_STT_Assistant

Created by Brandon Proteau (WPI BS CS '27) for the World Trails Network Americas'/Pan American Trails' NL-Digital Library (or Sustainable Trails Toolbox wiki).

_See the wiki [here](https://mountainsteward.net/toolbox/wiki/index.php/Main_Page)._

Thank you to the team, advisors, and our sponsors, Nathaniel Scrimshaw, Andras Molnar, and Jacky Tao for everyone's help along the way. 

## API Keys
This project handles all API calls in the flask backend (See /chat/ route). API keys must be personally obtained prior to software use and added to a text file. 

Create file named "keys.txt" and format it like this:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY = "Gemini api key here";
GOOGLE_API_KEY = "programmable search engine api key here";
SEARCH_ENGINE_ID = "programmable search engine id here";
```
For an in depth guide to this software and its implementation, see the relevant paper and supplemental materials. (Paper likely to be available by late October '25).
